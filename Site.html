		<h2> Section One</h2>
		<p >A parallax website is a type of website design that uses the parallax effect to create an immersive user experience. The parallax effect is created by having different elements of the website move at different speeds as the user scrolls down the page, creating a 3D-like effect.

In a parallax website, the background images move at a slower speed than the foreground images, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality. This effect can be used to highlight different aspects of the website's content, and can help to create a more engaging and interactive user experience.

Parallax websites can be used for a variety of purposes, from simple informational websites to more complex e-commerce sites. They are often used for storytelling or to showcase a product or service in a visually compelling way.

Overall, a parallax website is a visually dynamic and engaging type of website design that can help to create a memorable user experience.
